2. Improve the efficiency and reliability of transaction data and event processing through the use of AWS's cutting-edge technologies and IBM MQ's proven messaging capabilities.
3. Streamline the management and monitoring of the infrastructure, reducing operational costs and complexity.
4. Create a seamless integration with existing systems and processes, minimizing disruption and ensuring a smooth transition to the new platform.

### Target Outcomes & Success Metrics

1. Enhanced system reliability and resilience, with a 99.99% uptime target and the ability to recover from failures within minutes.
2. A 20% reduction in operational costs due to streamlined infrastructure management and monitoring.
3. Improved security and compliance with industry standards.
