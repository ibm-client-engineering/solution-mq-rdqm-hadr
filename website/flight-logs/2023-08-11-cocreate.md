## Work in progress
- One of the key members of the client's technical team was unable to join todayâ€™s session, and this limited what could be achieved in this session.
- We worked some in the customer's environment and then we discussed the state of their GitHub repo.
## Currently Tracking
- The client will verify their team's availability for the next session.
## Next Steps
- The goal is to meet and continue to update the terraform code.
