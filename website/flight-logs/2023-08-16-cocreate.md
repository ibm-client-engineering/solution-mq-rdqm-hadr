## Work in progress
- During our latest meeting, we took a deep dive into the current pipeline setup and assessed the needs for the Terraform and Ansible code moving forward.
## Currently Tracking
- Separating Infrastructure: To streamline development, weâ€™re organizing region builds into separate folders, each with its own Terraform run. This way, we can cater to specific region requirements effectively.
- Unified Management: Weâ€™re managing both regions using a single tfvars file, simplifying configuration management and oversight.
- Region-Specific Variables: Weâ€™re incorporating region-specific variables into the shared tfvars file for more targeted configurations.
- Deployment Order: Weâ€™re strategizing the best sequence for deployment, starting with the primary region, then standby, and finally the bastion. This aligns with the pipelineâ€™s approval process.
- Dependency Awareness: Itâ€™s essential to have fully established infrastructure before using Ansible from the bastion.
## Next Steps
- We going to take the feedback from this session and integrate it into our existing code and prepare for the next coding session.
