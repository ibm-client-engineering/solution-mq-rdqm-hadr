## Work in progress
- Today the team had a coding session and worked to implement the Terraform in the client's environment.
- There was a discussion on the Terraform functionality and we gave a demo of the code spinning up two regions.
## Currently Tracking
- Incorporate some updates to allow terraform to create and manage SSH keys for the bastion to communicate with the MQ nodes.
- The team will test the code from the client's pipeline.
## Next Steps
- The client and our team will work through some access issues to the customer's Repo and test the code in their pipeline.
