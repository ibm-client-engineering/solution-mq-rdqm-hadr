## Work in progress
- Today the team continued to work and implement changes to the terraform code.
- The team worked on, discussed the pipeline, and attempted to push in the code.
## Currently Tracking
- There were changes to the client's pipeline. It now requires merge requests for any code pushes to any connected branch to the pipeline and code verifications need to pass.
## Next Steps
- The client and our team will continue to work through the pipeline functionality and prepare for testing in our next session.
