## Work in progress
- Today the team continued to test the terraform code in the client's pipeline.
- The team continued to troubleshoot the EC2 shutdown issue.
- After some troubleshooting, we found that the KMS keys were the issue.
- We were then able to create the EC2 instances in multiple regions.
- The team is now troubleshooting moving files into the EC2 instances to kick off the ansible.
## Currently Tracking
- The client will do additional troubleshooting moving files into the EC2 instances and give us feedback on our next session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to optimize and implement the terraform code into the client's environment.
