## Work in progress
- Today the team continued to do test runs of the Ansible code.
- The team ran into some additional errors during deployment and the team did some troubleshooting.
- There was an issue with the kernel being unsupported. But this should be addressed using MQ version 9.3.3
## Currently Tracking
- The client will re-run the Ansible with the updated MQ version and will give us feedback in our next session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to optimize and implement the Ansible code into the client's environment.
