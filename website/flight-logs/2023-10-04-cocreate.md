## Work in progress
- Today the team continued to do test runs of the Ansible code.
- Using MQ version 9.3.3 resolved our kernel support issues from the previous session.
- We noticed during our testing that the client was using an older version of the Ansible code, and we spent time today pulling and staging the latest version.  
## Currently Tracking
- The client will re-run the Ansible with the updated code and will give us feedback in our next session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to optimize and implement the Ansible code into the client's environment.
